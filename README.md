# Prototype based clustering on seeds dataset
This a solution notebook to an assignment question given in a Data Mining graduate course. Each code block is accompanied by relevant analysis wherever required. </br>
Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds </br>
Broadly, the following steps have been performed in this solution notebook:
<ul>
<li> Minimal preprocessing on the dataset </li>
<li> Explained limitations of KMeans </li>
<li>Suggested two existing algorithms (KMedoids and CLARANS) that use some technique to mitigate limitations of KMeans </li>
<li> Visualization of given class labels using TSNE</li>
<li> Ran KMedoids and CLARANS on the seeds dataset and reported the best results
obtained on various cluster validity indices.
<ul> <li> Further compared the results with KMeans.  </li></ul>
</li> 
<li>  Reported and visualized the hyperparameter tuning for KMedoids and CLARANS required
to achieve the best results obtained on the seeds dataset </li>

These above assumptions and the flow of work is according to the questions asked in assignment.
